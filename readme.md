# Immerse Murder Mystery

This pack was made since 2022 and (still) is designed for Hive Bedrock's Murder Mystery gamemode. There's also a compatibility with the Ghost Invasion event gamemode with this.

## Theming?

Sci-Fi! I thought this fits well with the theming of most of the maps. The zapper now looked like an actual firearm with high-tech appearance. And so do the soundscape concerned.

## Installation

(For Android users only)
Open the tab options menu and enable desktop view (or anything similar to it).

Press the big green `Code` button and press the `Download ZIP` button. From there, you have two options:

1. Open the ZIP file and drag it to your resourcepacks directory (Harder route)
2. Rename the file extention to .mcpack and open it. (Easier route)

## Caveat

This pack is designed for Hive's Murder Mystery gamemode and as such will conflict anything else.
